##Using the Dropbox node in Node-RED

When in Node-RED, drag the dropbox node to the palette and double click it - you will be presented with the Edit popup

![NodeRedStarter](images/dropbox_edit.png)


Click the pencil button - you will be presented with the "Add new dropbox-config" config node


![NodeRedStarter](images/dropbox_edit_appkeys.png)

Fill in the App Key, App Secret and Token with the ones you saved earlier in this description - you will now be able to access your dropbox account from within Node-RED on Bluemix for any of the Labs.  Click Add.  NOTE : if you use a dropbox node in different Tabs of Node-RED then you only need to configure one of them and all dropbox nodes will share the configuration. 

NOTE : if you delete a dropbox node from one Tab of Node-RED then you will lose the config for all dropbox nodes !!
