##Personality Insights

The IBM Watson Personality Insights service uses linguistic analytics to infer cognitive and social characteristics, including Big Five, Values, and Needs, from communications that the user makes available, such as email, text messages, tweets, forum posts, and more, go to [personal-insights](http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/personality-insights.html) for a full description and demo

The objective is to send the Personality Insights node the same data as for the demo (https://watson-pi-demo.mybluemix.net/) and to show the JSON object and its values match those of the demo

Create a new application using the Node-RED starter boilerplate option in Bluemix

Click on the icon of the application

Pick “Add a Service or API” and click the Personality Insights node under Watson section.  Make sure your Application is listed and click on Use.  Click on Restage.

Drag an inject node to the palette.

Drag the personality insights node to the palette.

Drag a debug node to the palette.

Join them as shown below

Double-click the debug node and replace ‘payload’ to ‘insights’. Also change “to” to “debug tab and console”

Double-click the inject node and change Payload to string.  Go to [sample file](personal_insights_input_text.txt) and open the file and pasts the text to the blank field below the Payload field (this is the same text that is used in the demo).

Open a command line on your laptop and login to Bluemix with your username/password.  Navigate to the organisation and space to where your application is located.

Type **cf logs app_name**

where **app_name** is the name of your application.  Return to the Node-RED palette.

Click the Deploy button

Click on the debug tab to the top right of the palette.

Click the button next to the inject node.  

You will see an output in the debug tab starting with '{ [msg.insights] : object }' followed by the JSON object.  NOTE : you will not be able to see the full object

Compare the items in the JSON object to those of the demo for Personality Insights - you can see that the values shown are the same (or very similar).
